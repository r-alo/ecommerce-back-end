# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Your Task

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


## Deployment

After cloning this repository run:

```bash
npm i
```

This will install:
- @types/sequelize
- dotenv
- express
- mysql2
- sequelize

You'll need to create first  a DB in MySQL Shell as seen on the walk-through video

Once you have your DB created, run:

```bash
npm run seed
```

To seed your DB and be able to try out the routes.


After this, open your terminal on the parent folder and run:

```bash
node server.js
```

OR 

```bash
npm run start
```

Start testing on your preferred API platform for route calls
